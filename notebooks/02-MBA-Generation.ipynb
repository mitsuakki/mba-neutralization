    "## MBA Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of proven MBA exist nowadays, but since it's only about mathematics, couldn't we generate them in order to be able to detect them more easily ?<br>\n",
    "The RNN would have a better training set, the pattern recognizer will have more patterns to check and it will also help to find a way to use math for the neutralization.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "MBA Generation Approach. Zhou et al.(2007)â€™s work described a high-level principle for constructing MBA obfuscation rules from the truth tables and the linear equation system.<br>\n",
    "However, their work did not answer practical questions when building a large scale of MBA transformation rules, such as:\n",
    "* the number of variables in one expression;\n",
    "* the length of the MBA corpus;\n",
    "* the cost of generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninon Eyrolles (2017) has proven that 2-variable and 3-variable MBA expressions are commonly used in practical software obfuscation. <br>\n",
    "Since we understand AI, but doesn't have time, we are gonna use the amazing work that is [NeuReduce](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.56.pdf).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "ToDo : details explanation of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we our dataset of complex MBA we have to simplify them !"
