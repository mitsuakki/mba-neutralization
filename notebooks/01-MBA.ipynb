    "As we said earlier an **MBA** expression is one that combine arithmetic operations such as (`ADD`,  `SUB`, `MUL`, etc..) with bitwise operations (`XOR`, `AND`, `NOT`, `OR`, etc..)<br> All this operations have a corresponding symbol to decribe them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Operator** | **Symbol** | **Description**      |\n",
    "|--------------|------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| ADD          | +          | Addition             |\n",
    "| SUB          | -          | Subtraction          |\n",
    "| MUL          | *          | Multiplication       |\n",
    "| XOR          | ^          | Exclusive OR (XOR)   |\n",

    "The concept of MBA allows to transform a simple expression into one that is more or less difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For exemple, this simple expression `x+y` is equivalent to this one `2*(-1)-(~x)-(~y)`, here's how:\n",
    "1. Start with the given expression:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   2 \\cdot (-1) - (\\sim x) - (\\sim y)\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluate `2 * (-1)`:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   2 \\cdot (-1) = -2\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   The expression becomes:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   -2 - (\\sim x) - (\\sim y)\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Substitute the binary representation of `~x` and `~y`:  \n",
    "   In binary logic, `~x = -x-1` and `~y = -y-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Substitute these into the expression:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   -2 - (-x - 1) - (-y - 1)\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplify the terms:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   -2 + x + 1 + y + 1\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Combine constants:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   x + y + 0\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final result:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   x + y\n",
    "   \\\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this expression is also equivalent to (2*(x | y)) - (x ^ y) and many more that we probably doesn't know at the moment !! <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each expressions with two variables `x` and `y`, it exists 28 basic combinations. <br>\n",
    "With parentheses and several operators combined, the number of MBAs becomes potentially infinitely large."
